## How to Use This Website

1. Choose one specific course (e.g., ICS 45C in the 2021 Fall Quarter). The most convenient way to choose a course is to select a Department, Course Number, and Quarter; 
if you want to narrow down your search, you can add an Instructor and/or Course Type. If you only want to see one specific section of a course, you can just enter a Course Code and Quarter.
2. When you're ready, click the Submit button. If you want to clear your whole search, press the Reset button.
3. You will be directed to the enrollment data; to switch between tabs, click the Graphs, Tables, or Quarters buttons below the name of the course.
4. To open/close graphs and tables, click the appropriate blue button on the right.
5. To see the enrollment data of a course you searched before, click the History button and click the appropriate course.
