                </li>
                <li>
                  If you don't specify a quarter, you will be directed to the most
                  recent quarter the course was available.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              When you're ready, click the <b>Submit</b> button. If you want to
              clear your whole search, press the <b>Reset</b> button.
            </li>
            <li>
              You will be directed to the enrollment data; to switch between
              tabs, click the <b>Graphs</b>, <b>Tables</b>, or

              on the right.

        <div class="text-section">
          <h4>What are the Graphs, Tables, and Quarters tabs?</h4>
          <hr />
          <ul>
            <li>
              The <b>Graphs</b> tab uses line graphs to show the change in
              enrolled, max, and waitlist students.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <b>Tables</b> tab uses tables to show the enrolled, max,
              waitlist (if available), requested, and nor (if available)
              students; the course status (if available) will also be recorded.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <b>Quarters</b> tab will show you the other quarters that
              satisfy your search. For example, if you are looking for a WRITING
              39C course with a specific instructor, this tab will show you the
              other quarters where WRITING 39C is offered with that instructor.
